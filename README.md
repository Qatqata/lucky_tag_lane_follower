# AprilTag Detection with Duckiebot 

This repository is based on the [Duckietown ROS Template](https://github.com/duckietown/template-ros) and is used to detect AprilTags on a Duckiebot. The robot can interpret tag positions and publish relevant messages or transformations. Originally intended for SLAM, this project shifted focus solely to AprilTag detection and reaction due to time constraints.

##  Quick Start

Ensure You are running the commands below in separate terminals.

### Build the container

```bash
dts devel build -H lucky -f
```

### Run the publisher node

```bash
dts devel run -H lucky -L tag_publisher_launch -n publisher
```

### Run the subscriber node

```bash
dts devel run -H lucky -L tag_subscriber_launch -n subscriber
```

---

##  Functionality

The system uses the robot's camera to:

- Detect AprilTags using the `apriltag` Python library.
- Estimate each tag's 3D pose using `cv2.solvePnP`.
- Publish:
  - Tag detections on `/apriltag_detections`
  - Estimated poses on `/apriltag_poses`
  - Semantic string messages on `/apriltag_messages`
- Broadcast TF transforms between frames.

### Example tag-based messages

| Tag ID | Message |
|--------|---------|
| 2      | "lucky says to yield" |
| 6      | "lucky says to go right" |
| 7      | "lucky says to go left" |
| 20     | "lucky says to stop" |
| 74     | "lucky says to wait for the traffic light" |
| 96     | "lucky says to slow down" |

##  Configuration Notes

- The camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients need to be replaced with your own robot's calibration values. 
- add the name of your robot to the topics
- We used the default tag size: `0.065 m` (6.5 cm).
